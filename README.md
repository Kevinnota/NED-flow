# NED-flow

NED-flow is a pipeline developed for using <ins>**N**</ins>uclear reference genomes to classify reads obtained from shotgun-sequenced ancient samples <ins>**E**</ins>nvironmental <ins>**D**</ins>NA using a Next<ins>**flow**</ins> backbone. The tool contains tools for database management & building and for preprocessing reads, mapping and taxonomic classifying. The pipeline was designed specifically for nuclear reference genomes/assemblies.

In short, NED-flow is downloading all reference genomes deposited on NCBI. Ned-ref-manager.py is written in a way that it will download all reference genomes the first time â€“ and only updates the exciting reference genomes subsequently. So only new assemblies and updated assemblies are downloaded. Th make-ref-sink.py is a tool that will concatenate bacteria/fungi/archaea into sinks that are used for mapping and removing potential microorganism contamination in reference genomes. The ned-build.nf is a Nextflow tool that will index only the genomes that need to be indexed. It can do this both locally and on an SGE/SLURM cluster. 

> [!WARNING]
> Downloading all plant, vertebrate, and invertebrate genomes available at present requires <ins>**~23T**</ins> of free disk space. Before starting to download and build the database, make sure there is enough space available.
