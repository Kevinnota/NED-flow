Welcome to NED-flow's documentation!
====================================

NED-flow is a pipeline developed for using Nuclear reference genomes to classify reads obtained from shotgun-sequenced ancient samples Environmental DNA using a Nextflow backbone. The tool contains tools for database management & building and for preprocessing reads, mapping and taxonomic classifying. The pipeline was designed specifically for nuclear reference genomes/assemblies obtained from GenBank.

In short, NED-flow is downloading all reference genomes deposited on NCBI. Ned-ref-manager.py is written in a way that it will download all reference genomes the first time â€“ and only updates the existing reference genomes subsequently. Only new assemblies and updated assemblies are downloaded. The make-ref-sink.py is a tool that will concatenate bacteria/fungi/archaea genomes into sinks that are used for mapping and removing potential microorganism contamination in reference genomes. The ned.nf --build is a Nextflow tool that will index only the genomes that need to be indexed. It can do this both locally and on an SGE/SLURM cluster.
